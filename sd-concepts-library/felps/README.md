### Felps on Stable Diffusion
This is the `<Felps>` concept taught to Stable Diffusion via Textual Inversion. You can load this concept into the [Stable Conceptualizer](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/stable_conceptualizer_inference.ipynb) notebook. You can also train your own concepts and load them into the concept libraries using [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/sd_textual_inversion_training.ipynb).

Here is the new concept you will be able to use as an `object`:
